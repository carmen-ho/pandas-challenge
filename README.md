In reviewing the top performing schools by % overall passing, the top schools are all charter schools. In reviewing the bottom performing schools by % overall passing, the bottom schools are all district schools. In analyzing the per student budget for both top and bottom schools, the average budget for both is about the same in the $600 range. It appears that even though the same budget is spent for per student, the charter schools are better in terms of % overall passing. 

There is also a trend in the charter (top performing schools) having both % passing math and reading at around 90% while the district (bottom performing schools) have about the same % passing math around 60% and % passing reading around 80%. It appears that students do about the same in charter school and in district they are better at readng than math.

Another interesting trend in reviewing the scores by school spending, it appears that the higher the budget bin, the lower the % overall passing while the lower the budget bin, the higher the % overall passing. Also of importance to note is that the larger the school size bin, the lower the % overall passing which may imply that the more students there are the less focus on each student to help them pass with a higher passing score.
